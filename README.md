# DeepSeek-LLM-Exploration
 DeepSeek LLM Exploration DeepSeek LLM Exploration Feb 2025 - Feb 2025Feb 2025 - Feb 2025 Objective: Evaluated DeepSeek, an open-source large language model (LLM), comparing its efficiency, reasoning capabilities, and deployment options against OpenAI’s models.

Key Learnings & Tools:

Tools Used: DeepSeek, Ollama, Chatbox, OpenAI

Concepts Explored: Advanced reasoning, token efficiency, self-hosting, temperature settings
Findings: Compared DeepSeek's response accuracy, token optimization, and offline usability with OpenAI’s models. Observed performance differences based on model sizes (1.5B vs. 8B parameters) and temperature variations in generated responses.

Impact & Reflection:
This hands-on project enhanced my understanding of LLM performance metrics, model adaptability, and the trade-offs between open-source and proprietary AI solutions. It reinforced the importance of continuous testing and practical application in AI model evaluation
